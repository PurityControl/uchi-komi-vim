#+TITLE: Uchi komi for Vim (VimL)

* Problem Sets
The problem sets for all uchi komi language repos are held in a dedicated
repo. This avoids having to keep problems in sync across all the repos.
A problem can now be added to the individual language repo only when ready
to tackle it.
The problem repo is at [[https://github.com/PurityControl/uchi-komi-problems]]
